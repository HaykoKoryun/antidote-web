WARNING - this is not meant for a production antidote deployment.
The production deployment does not use this file, and actually deletes
the manager application, and other application that isn't antidote.

If you need to use this for debugging purposes, modify the Dockerfile to not
delete the manager app, and copy this file to /usr/local/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
